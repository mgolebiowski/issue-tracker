# Issue tracker project

Clone repository and run your prefered dependency manager.

Create a config file based on sample one (name it `config/main.js`). Add your mongodb configuration and check if default port is open or change it.

You can run production version using `yarn build` or run development mode by running separately `yarn frontend:run` and `yarn backend:run`.

Enjoy!
